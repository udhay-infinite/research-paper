  /* recommended strategy:
     read in the first value of the file (prev) before the loop starts.
     Then in the while loop read next short in.
     In the loop you are to be looking for critical events:  zero crossings or sign changes.
     Before you start writing that code start out just echoing each value and the sample # associated with it.
     Once that is right start printing an alert whenever zero is touched/crossed OR or the direction changes.
     Zero crossings and direction changes are the critical events you must correctly detect.
     Once that is right then try to detect the start of the first wave.
     Once that is right add code to  detect the end of the first wave.
     Then start coding to detet every wave - counting samples per wave and
     keeping track of the highest and lowest value in that wave.
